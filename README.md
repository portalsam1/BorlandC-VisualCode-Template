# BorlandC-VisualCode-Template
BorlandC Visual Studio Code Project Template, relies on BorlandC 3.1 and DOSBox because I'm insane.

Uses VSCode tasks to run COMPILE.BAT and LAUNCH.BAT (Because I'm insane times two.) (Feel free to write a bash script.)

Assumes you have BorlandC installed on your C drive root at C:\BORLANDC, and that your DOSBox autoexec mounts C:\ on startup. (Even though this is not reccomended it breaks the compiler usually if a subfolder is mounted.)
